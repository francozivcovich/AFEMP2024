    "We just got a job at a Toy factory! In a production line, a toy cow (of about 17cm of height) is produced by moulding an hollow aluminum hull that is then set to cool on a fresh and ventilated surface at room temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the (whole) toy has a temperature lower than $60^\\circ C$, it is deemed safe for the workers to grab the product and place it in its packaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that room temperature is $T_r = 30^\\circ C$, that moulding temperature is $400^\\circ C$, and that the toy cow's feet (the bottom 25mm) are already at room temperature because how the moulding machine works (we're not paid to make questions, no one has the answers anyways) we are tasked to determine mathematically the amount of time it has to pass before the toy is safe to grab."
